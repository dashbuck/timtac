A personalized take on the [Timber Starter Theme](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme). Not an official fork.

[Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) is an extreme take on atomic CSS that I find appealing. WordPress is set up for semantic CSS. Tachyons already makes the HTML file hella messy; I didn't want WordPress's standard, automatically created classes making everything worse. Besides which, Tachyons needs to be paired with a templating language to shine. Therefore, Timber.
